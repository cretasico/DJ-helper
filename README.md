# DJ-Helper ðŸŽ¶

**DJ-Helper** is a personal project designed to simplify organizing a DJ's music library through an intuitive visual interface. This project evolved from my earlier Python-based organizer [Python-DJ-Organizer](https://github.com/cretasico/python-dj-organizer), which provided a code-based method for sorting and categorizing music. With DJ-Helper, the goal is to streamline the process and offer DJs a more flexible tool for crafting varied and engaging mixes.

### Project Details

- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **Telerik**: For building the user interface.
  - **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a structured, maintainable codebase.
  - **Excel Libraries** (non-commercial use): Facilitates reading and updating music data directly from spreadsheets.

> **Note**: DJ-Helper is still in active development, so expect ongoing changes and updates. Once the project is closer to completion, I'll be sharing more technical insights and usage details on my blog.
